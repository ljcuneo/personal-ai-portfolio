          Hi, I&apos;m Luciano! I am a software engineer fueled by{" "}
          <strong>creativity</strong>, passion for <strong>technology</strong>{" "}
          and a commitment to continuous <strong>learning</strong>. My journey
          began with a Bachelor of Science in Digital Communications, which
          ignited my interest in web design. After gaining valuable experience
          as a digital content creator, I decided to deepen my technical
          expertise by pursuing a degree in Computer Science from Florida
          International University. Currently, I am furthering my knowledge by
          pursuing a Master&apos;s degree in Cybersecurity at Georgia Institute
          of Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I love flying FPV drones, capturing aerial
          photography, catching waves during a surfing session, exploring new
          hiking trails, and enjoying a good movie.
